H-Index

Given an array of citations (each citation is a non-negative integer) of a researcher, write a function to compute the researcher's h-index.

According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: "A scientist has index h if h of his/her N papers have at least h citations each, and the other N âˆ’ h papers have no more than h citations each."

Example:

Input: citations = [3,0,6,1,5]
Output: 3
Explanation: [3,0,6,1,5] means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had
             received 3, 0, 6, 1, 5 citations respectively.
             Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining
             two with no more than 3 citations each, her h-index is 3.

Note: If there are several possible values for h, the maximum one is taken as the h-index.

public class HIndex {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(hIndex(new int[]{3, 1, 0, 5, 6}));
    }

    public static int hIndex(int[] citations) {
        Arrays.sort(citations);
        int len = citations.length;
        for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
            if (citations[i] >= len - i) return len - i;

        }
        return 0;
    }
}
